# QOC (Quadrant One Core)

A new graphics rendering core (alpha version)

## About
QOC is designed to rethink how rendering should work from the ground up.  
Instead of relying on heavy GPU pipelines or complex engines, QOC focuses on:

- Full visibility into each frame — understand every pixel, every ray.
- CPU-first design — minimal, predictable, and portable.
- Mathematics-driven rendering — everything is calculated with integer coordinates and vectors.
- Frame-centric animation — each frame is a snapshot, perfect for learning and experimentation.

## Philosophy
Rendering is not just about pixels or triangles; it's about understanding the process.  
QOC aims to give developers, learners, and animators a clear view of what's happening inside the core.

- No hidden magic, no black boxes.
- Focus on clarity, control, and simplicity.
- Works on low-end machines and scales naturally to high-end hardware.

## Future Direction
- Expand to full animation tool support.
- Implement time and keyframe concepts.
- Support BMP export and console visualization.
- Provide a minimal but powerful base for learning graphics and building experiments.
